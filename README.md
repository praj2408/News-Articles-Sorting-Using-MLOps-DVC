# News-Articles-Sorting-using-MLOps - Ongoing
## Overview
The News-Articles-Sorting project is a machine learning-based system that aims to automatically categorize and sort news articles into predefined categories. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification of news articles.

This repository contains all the necessary code and resources to train and deploy the News-Articles-Sorting model. The project utilizes a labeled dataset of news articles, where each article is assigned to a specific category. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, the system can then classify unseen news articles into the appropriate categories.

## Problem Statement:
In today’s world, data is power. With News companies having terabytes of data stored in
servers, everyone is in the quest to discover insights that add value to the organization.
With various examples to quote in which analytics is being used to drive actions, one that
stands out is news article classification.

Nowadays on the Internet there are a lot of sources that generate immense amounts of
daily news. In addition, the demand for information by users has been growing
continuously, so it is crucial that the news is classified to allow users to access the
information of interest quickly and effectively. This way, the machine learning model for
automated news classification could be used to identify topics of untracked news and/or
make individual suggestions based on the user’s prior interests.

## Approach
Techniques like clustering and associating rule-based algorithms can be
applied to group together similar text. The ML algorithms learn the mapping function
between the text and the tags based on already categorized data. Algorithms such as
SVM, Neural Networks, Random Forest are commonly used for text classification.
